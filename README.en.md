# PDF Optimizer Suite 🚀 v4.1.1

**The ultimate right-click tool for compressing PDFs and converting Word documents.**

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📉 Advanced Compression
Uses tuned ImageMagick 7 core with JPEG 4:2:0 subsampling to reduce file sizes by up to 90% while keeping text sharp.

### 🔄 Silent Word Conversion
Convert `.docx` and `.doc` files to optimized PDF instantly. The suite automates MS Word in the background—no manual "Save As" required.

### 🕵️ Camouflage Mode (Privacy 2.0)
Go beyond basic stripping. Our engine injects fake metadata from professional office scanners (HP LaserJet, Canon iR-ADV, Xerox), making your digital files look like hardware-scanned originals.

### 🛡️ Enterprise & LTSC Compatible
*   **Embedded Python:** Comes with its own runtime. No system-wide Python installation needed.
*   **No Admin Rights:** Optimization runs entirely in user-mode.
*   **Bypasses GPO Blocks:** New registration engine works even where PowerShell/VBS is restricted.
